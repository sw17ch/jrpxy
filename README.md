# jrpxy, aka John's Reverse Proxy

An *EXPERIMENTAL* toolkit for building reverse proxies in HTTP/1.1 with an
emphasis on using types to guide framing. I also am attempting to build ways to
more easily use tools like io-uring or `splice()` to move data between sockets,
though these parts are aspirational rather than actual at the moment.
